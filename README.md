# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Chest-X-rays
Detection of Pneumonia using Convulsion Neural networks (CNN) by Chest X rays

The code has been developed in Python using Convulsion Neural networks (CNN).
Unfortunately couldn't add the X-rays used for training purpose but you can use your own data sets and train them.
for any issues refer to the Project documentation.
